## Design Patterns

- [ ] Singleton Pattern - Ensuring a class has only one instance and providing global access to it
- [ ] Observer Pattern - Defining a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified
- [ ] Factory Pattern - Defining an interface for creating an object but letting subclasses alter the type of object that will be created
- [ ] Decorator Pattern - Attaching additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
- [ ] Adapter Pattern - Converting the interface of a class into another interface clients expect

## Object-Oriented Programming

- [ ] Encapsulation - Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit
- [ ] Inheritance - Creating new classes based on existing classes to promote code reuse
- [ ] Polymorphism - Allowing objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same type
- [ ] Abstraction - Hiding complex implementation details while exposing only essential features
- [ ] SOLID Principles - Understanding the five principles of object-oriented design

## Software Architecture

- [ ] MVC Architecture - Separating an application into three interconnected components
- [ ] Layered Architecture - Organizing code into distinct layers with specific responsibilities
- [ ] Microservices Concepts - Understanding the principles of decomposing applications into smaller services
- [ ] RESTful API Design - Creating APIs that adhere to REST constraints
- [ ] Event-Driven Architecture - Designing systems that respond to events or changes in state

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Memory Management - Understanding how memory is allocated and managed
- [ ] Caching Strategies - Implementing various caching mechanisms to improve performance
- [ ] Database Query Optimization - Writing efficient queries and using proper indexing
- [ ] Code Splitting - Breaking down large codebases into smaller chunks for faster loading
- [ ] Asynchronous Programming - Managing operations that don't block the main execution thread

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Integration Testing - Testing the interaction between different modules or services
- [ ] End-to-End Testing - Testing complete user workflows from start to finish
- [ ] Using Mocks and Stubs - Creating simulated objects for testing purposes
- [ ] Test Coverage - Measuring and improving the amount of code exercised by tests
- [ ] Automated Testing Pipeline - Implementing continuous testing in development workflows

## Web Development Advanced

- [ ] State Management - Managing data flow and application state in complex applications
- [ ] Security Best Practices - Implementing measures to protect applications from threats
- [ ] Responsive Design - Creating layouts that work well on various screen sizes
- [ ] Frontend Performance Optimization - Improving loading times and runtime performance
- [ ] Cross-Browser Compatibility - Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers

## Database Advanced Concepts

- [ ] Indexing Strategies - Optimizing database performance through proper indexing
- [ ] Transaction Management - Ensuring data integrity during complex operations
- [ ] Database Normalization - Organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity
- [ ] NoSQL Databases - Understanding non-relational database concepts and use cases
- [ ] Database Backup and Recovery - Implementing strategies for data protection

## DevOps Fundamentals

- [ ] CI/CD Concepts - Understanding Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment workflows
- [ ] Containerization - Packaging applications and dependencies into containers
- [ ] Cloud Services Concepts - Understanding cloud computing models and services
- [ ] Monitoring and Logging - Implementing systems to track application health and performance
- [ ] Basic Automation - Automating repetitive development and deployment tasks
