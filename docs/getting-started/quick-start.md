## Overview

This guide will help you quickly understand how to use the Skills4Coder project, find the right skill list for your level, and begin tracking your progress.

## Step 1: Determine Your Skill Level

Skills4Coder organizes skills into four levels:

### Beginner
- **Best for**: Developers with 0-1 years of experience
- **Focus**: Programming fundamentals and core concepts
- **Directory**: `skill-lists/beginner/`
- **Start here if**: You're new to programming or have minimal experience

### Intermediate
- **Best for**: Developers with 1-3 years of experience
- **Focus**: Software design patterns and common practices
- **Directory**: `skill-lists/intermediate/`
- **Start here if**: You can build applications but want to improve architecture skills

### Advanced
- **Best for**: Developers with 3-5 years of experience
- **Focus**: System design and architectural decisions
- **Directory**: `skill-lists/advanced/`
- **Start here if**: You design complex systems and mentor others

### Expert
- **Best for**: Developers with 5+ years of experience
- **Focus**: Strategic architecture and technical leadership
- **Directory**: `skill-lists/expert/`
- **Start here if**: You lead teams and make strategic technical decisions

## Step 2: Access the Skill Lists

### Option A: Browse Online
Visit the Skills4Coder repository on GitHub:
```
https://github.com/standup-coder/skills4coder
```

Navigate to the appropriate directory based on your skill level:
- `/skill-lists/beginner/` - For beginners
- `/skill-lists/intermediate/` - For intermediate developers
- `/skill-lists/advanced/` - For advanced developers
- `/skill-lists/expert/` - For expert developers

### Option B: Download Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/standup-coder/skills4coder.git
cd skills4coder

# Navigate to your level
cd skill-lists/beginner/  # or intermediate/advanced/expert/
```

## Step 3: Use the Skill Lists

Each skill list follows this format:

```markdown
# Category Title

- [ ] Skill Name - Brief description of the skill
- [ ] Another Skill - Another brief description
- [x] Completed Skill - This one is checked off indicating completion
```

### Tracking Your Progress

1. **Copy the list**: Make a copy of the skill list to track your progress
   ```bash
   cp skill-lists/beginner/skills.md my_progress_tracker.md
   ```

2. **Mark completed skills**: Replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for skills you've mastered
   ```markdown
   # Before
   - [ ] Variables and Data Types

   # After
   - [x] Variables and Data Types
   ```

3. **Regular review**: Periodically review your progress and update your tracker

## Step 4: Find Learning Resources

Each skill list ends with curated learning resources:

```markdown
## Learning Resources

1. [Resource Name](https://example.com) - Description of the resource
2. [Another Resource](https://example.com) - Description of another resource
```

Use these resources to develop the skills listed in each category.

## Step 5: Set Goals and Milestones

### Progress Tracking Formula
```
Completion Rate = (Completed Skills / Total Skills) × 100%
```

### Milestone Targets
- **25%**: Good foundation, keep going
- **50%**: Midway milestone, stay motivated
- **75%**: Near completion, push forward
- **100%**: Achievement reached, advance to next level

## Next Steps

After completing a skill list:

1. **Move to the next level**: Graduate to the next difficulty level
2. **Teach others**: Share your knowledge (teaching reinforces learning)
3. **Contribute**: Add to the Skills4Coder project
4. **Explore specialties**: Dive deeper into specific technology areas

**Pro Tip**: Start with the skill level that feels slightly challenging but not overwhelming. It's better to start at the right level than to aim too high or too low initially.
