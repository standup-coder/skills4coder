## Step 4: Use the Vibe Coding Checklists

Each checklist follows this format:

```markdown
# Category Title

- [ ] Vibe Skill Name - Description of the skill
- [ ] Another Vibe Skill - Another description
- [x] Completed Vibe Skill - This one is checked off indicating completion
```

### Tracking Your Vibe Progress

1. **Copy the checklist**: Make a copy to track your vibe development
   ```bash
   cp skill-lists/beginner/skills.md my_vibe_progress_tracker.md
   ```

2. **Mark completed vibes**: Replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for skills you've practiced
   ```markdown
   # Before
   - [ ] Conscious Breathing During Coding

   # After
   - [x] Conscious Breathing During Coding
   ```

3. **Regular vibe check-ins**: Periodically review your progress and update your tracker

## Step 5: Find Vibe-Focused Activities

Each list ends with vibe-centered activities:

```markdown
## Activities & Exercises

1. [Activity Name](https://example.com) - Description of the vibe-building activity
2. [Another Activity](https://example.com) - Description of another activity
```

Use these activities to develop your vibe coding skills.

## Step 6: Set Vibe Goals and Milestones

### Progress Tracking Formula
```
Vibe Mastery Rate = (Practiced Vibe Skills / Total Vibe Skills) × 100%
```

### Milestone Targets
- **25%**: Good vibe foundation, keep flowing
