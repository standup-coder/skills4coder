## Introduction to Vibe Coding

Vibe Coding is a philosophy and approach to software development that emphasizes joy, creativity, mindfulness, and positive collaboration in the coding process. Unlike traditional approaches that may focus solely on technical outcomes, Vibe Coding incorporates human-centered practices that enhance both the developer experience and the quality of the resulting code.

### Core Philosophy
- **Creative Expression**: Treat code as a medium for artistic and creative expression
- **Collaborative Joy**: Find happiness in pair programming, code reviews, and team interactions
- **Mindful Presence**: Be fully present and intentional while coding

Calculate your Vibe Coding mastery rate:

```
Vibe Mastery Rate = (Practiced Vibe Skills / Total Vibe Skills) × 100%
```

```
If a list has 25 skills and you've practiced 15:
Vibe Mastery Rate = (15 / 25) × 100% = 60%
```

### Tracking Methods

1. **Simple Marking**: Use `[x]` to indicate practiced skills
2. **Date Stamping**: Add dates when you begin practicing skills
3. **Reflection Notes**: Include observations about your experiences
4. **Quantitative Measures**: Track frequency of practices (e.g., "daily", "weekly")

### Progress Visualization
