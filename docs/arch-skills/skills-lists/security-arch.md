## Introduction

Security Architecture focuses on integrating security into system design from the ground up. Security architects design systems that protect data, prevent unauthorized access, detect threats, and ensure compliance with security standards and regulations. This role requires deep understanding of security principles, threat modeling, and security technologies, as well as the ability to balance security requirements with business functionality.
