4. Use the suggested learning resources to enhance your skills
5. Track your progress by checking off mastered skills

### For Mentors and Educators

1. Use the skill lists as a curriculum guide
2. Adapt content to fit specific learning objectives
3. Create custom learning paths based on individual needs
4. Evaluate student or mentee progress against established benchmarks
